This folder contains a muste backend that interacts with a frontend via ajax/json.
Two example frontends can be found in the demo subfolder. One is based on 
[this demo](https://github.com/heatherleaf/muste/tree/ajax/demo).

It can be run as an standalone executable that provides a minimal webserver (default) 
or as a CGI application to be used with other webservers (configure with -f cgi).

To run the standalone server you can use `cabal run` in this folder and point your webbrowser to <http://localhost:8080> to access the demos
